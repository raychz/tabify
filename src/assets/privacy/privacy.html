    <h2><strong>Tabify Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Tabify, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, built the Tabify app
        to allow restaurant patrons to easily pay and split the bill
        from their
        phones. This Service is provided by
        Tabify, Inc. at no cost and is intended for
        use as is. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use our websites
        (including www.tabifyapp.com, m.tabifyapp.com), our mobile applications (including the Tabify mobile app for
        Android and iOS), and other Tabify products, services, and features that are available on or through our
        websites and mobile applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to use our Service, then you agree
        to the collection and use of information in relation to this
        policy. The Personal Information that we collect is
        used for providing and improving the Service.
        We will not use or share your
        information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
        Policy.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
        For a better experience, while using our Service,
        we may require you to provide us with certain
        personally identifiable information. We only collect information about
        you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our
        Services better. The
        information that we request and receive will be used as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Basic account information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
                    For
                    example,
                    we require individuals who sign up for a Tabify account to provide an email address and password,
                    along
                    with a name. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other
                    information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to create a Tabify account.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Public profile information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you
                    provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a Tabify account, your name is
                    part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like
                    a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so
                    please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Payment information: Tabify utilizes the services of independent, third-party payment processors in
                    order to provide the Services
                    and process your payments due to restaurants, bars, and other dining establishments in the Tabify
                    network. Such third party processors are responsible for securely
                    storing and processing your payment method information that you provide via the Tabify app. Tabify
                    does not
                    retain your payment method information and does not have direct control over the storage or
                    processing of
                    your payment method information for the Services. By submitting your payment method information, you
                    consent to the
                    sharing of such information with our third party payment processors and acknowledge that such third
                    parties may store your
                    credit and/or debit card information in connection with your use of the Services and Tabify. Our
                    third-party payment processing partners are PCI Level 1 Service Providers, the highest level of
                    PCI DSS certification.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Communications with us: You may also provide us with information when you respond to
                    surveys, communicate with our Tabify Team about a support question, post a question in our
                    public forums, or sign up for a newsletter. When you
                    communicate with us via form, email, phone, or otherwise, we store a copy of
                    our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Information from other sources: We may also get information about you from other sources. For
                    example, if you create or log in to your Tabify account through another service (like Facebook)
                    or if you connect your account to a social media service (like Facebook or Twitter),
                    we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile
                    information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service. The information we
                    receive depends on which services you authorize and what options are available.
                </p>

    <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
    <p>
        Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers
        typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language
        preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We
        collect this Log Data when you use our Services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
        sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
        are stored on your device's internal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
        However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
        use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
        services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
        these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your
        device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be
        able to use some portions of this Service.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
    <p>
        We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their
        services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our
        Services to you (like secure payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud
        prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment
        transactions, cloud compute and storage services, email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you,
        and
        customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you; those that
        assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying
        a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our
        services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make
        tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word
        processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that
        help us manage operations.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
        While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized
        access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for
        potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
    <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click
        on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
        Note that these external sites are not operated by
        us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to
        review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
        We have no control over and assume no
        responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
        practices of any third-party sites or services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personally
        identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
        we discover that a child under 13 has provided
        us with personal information,
        we immediately delete this from our servers. If you
        are a parent or guardian and you are aware of or suspect that your child
        has provided Tabify with personal information, please contact
        us immediately using the contact information provided in "Contact Us".
    </p>
    <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from
        time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. We will
        notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
        on this page. These changes are effective immediately after
        they are posted on this page.
