# Tabify

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install and configure the following:
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- Node (install Node using nvm and ensure that the version matches what is in the `.node-version` file)
- [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn)

### Installing

Follow these steps to get a local dev environment set up.

1. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

2. Run the development server.
```
npm start
```

Navigate to localhost:8100 on Chrome (note that the port may differ). If you see the login screen, you've successfully started up the dev server! ðŸŽ‰
